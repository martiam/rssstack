# RSSStack
A dockerised solution for scraping a single twitter list, serving it as a RSSFeed and saving it to a local database.

# üê≥ Twitter List RSS Stack

This project sets up a self-hosted system to monitor Twitter Lists via RSS using Docker Compose. It consists of three main containers:

- **RSSHub**: Fetches tweets from Twitter Lists using Twitter cookies.
- **FreshRSS**: Aggregates and stores tweet updates from RSSHub.
- **Cookiebot**: Automatically logs into Twitter and refreshes cookies used by RSSHub.
